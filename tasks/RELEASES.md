# Releases

Forward-looking release plan for this project. Each entry declares a
release's **scope** — the phases and tasks slated to ship in it —
*before* it ships, so the plan can be cross-referenced against
`ROADMAP.md` and the code.

`PHASES.md` and `ROADMAP.md` answer "what work exists." This file
answers "what work ships together, and when." It is the *plan*;
`tasks/AUDIT.md` is the *log* of what actually shipped.

## How to read this file

- 📋 **Planned** — scope declared, not yet building toward it.
- 🚧 **In progress** — the integration branch is accumulating it.
- ✅ **Shipped** — released; the `Tag` line records the git tag.

Newest release on top. `/release` reads this file to cross-check the
plan against what actually merged; `/roadmap` reads the ✅ Shipped
entries for its "Shipped in" column.

## v{{NEXT}} — 📋 Planned

**Target.** {{a date, a milestone, or "next" — when this should ship}}

**Scope.**
- Phase {{N}} — {{phase name}}
- TASK-{{NNN}} — {{a loose task not covered by a scoped phase, if any}}

**Notes.** {{optional — rationale, risk, what's deliberately out}}

---

*(One section per release, newest on top. When a release ships: flip
its status to ✅ Shipped, add a `**Tag.**` line with the git tag, and
append a 🚀 entry to `tasks/AUDIT.md`. `/release` cuts the release and
cross-checks this plan.)*
