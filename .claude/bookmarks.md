# 🔖 Bookmarks

Curated `path:line` pointers. Read this on session start to land
oriented instead of grep-scanning. Add anything you find yourself
re-finding.

Format: `[path:line](relative-link) — one-line context`. Keep
entries dense; one line each.

won't touch this file. Stale bookmarks are worse than missing ones
— prune when the code moves.*
